    "description": "Imperial Katana\n\nPrimary Weapon:\n  The ship has a laser blade mounted on its front.\n  Pressing the primary weapon key heats it up, without it the blade cools down.\n  The higher the heat, the more damage it does (no damage without enough heat).\n  If the heat goes too high the ship blows up. (The heat is indicated in place\n  of the battery.)\n  If the heat is above a value (set in impka.ini as Weapon/RadHeat) radioactivity\n  starts to build up (speed set in impka.ini as Weapon/RadBuildup). The process\n  is irreversible. When fully built up (as seen on the captain panel) a halo\n  appears around the ship and it is now radioactive.\n  \nSpecial:\n  Releases radioactivity in form of a gas cloud. The cloud is highly explosive,\n  so the ship needs to be fully cooled down to safely use this ability.\n\nNotes:\n  If a ship is radioactive it loses crew over time (as set in impka.ini Special\n  section). Most ships can not get rid of radioactivity and will slowly die.\n  The halo around a radioactive ship infects any other ship on contact.\n  If a radioactive ship (either the Katana or another) is destroyed the\n  radioactivity is released once again.\n\n * created by: cyhawk@sch.bme.hu and forevian@freemail.hu\n * idea by Forevian & Lord000"

If one encounters a ship, it 'Tags'\n it to allow the missiles to home in, even on cloaked ships.  If not, they expire in\n space.  A 'tagged' ship has a red flashing marker on it, really fun with clokers,\n but the beacon runs out of juice in about 8 seconds.\n\nWeaknesses\n Puny battery and below-average recharge.  Small crew complement for it's size.\n Center of gravity is near front of ship, so turning swings the tail back and forth,\n making it difficult to swerve out of the way of weapons.  The main weapon is mounted\n on an outrigger, so doesn't fire directly from the axis.  The ship also swivels on\n it's forward axis when turning, so the outrigger's distance from the axis changes.\n You MUST dart in and plant a beacon on something before you can fire missiles,\n they won't fire at all without one.  Is worthless against anything with\n point-defense, and pretty bad against long-range homing weapons or very graceful\n ships; a Hornet can beat it.\n \nStrengths\n Once you get a marker on a cloaker, they're pretty well helpless.  Just make\n sure you keep planting markers on them, or else you might lose them again.\n The only exception is the Exterminator; that ship is WAY too powerful, like\n a Druuge with good batteries that can cloak.  It is also good against a few\n large, slow ships.\n\nRace:\n They call themselves the Strivanar, little else is known.  Their eyesight  seems to\n be adapted to low light levels.  It is uncertain whether the many eyes observed all\n belong to the captain.\n\nUpdate July 15th, 2001:\n-----------------------\n-Allow multiple targets.\n\tConfigured in strsc.ini, default is 3.  No more than 16 are allowed.\n-Allow non-ship targets, aka planets, asteroids, mines.  To disable this, change\n\tmode=1 to mode=0 in strsc.ini\n-Made marker timing much more accurate\n-fixed annoying bug with Kohr-Ah blades by adding tiny offset to position"

Weapon:\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis vessel carries heavy bombs (d-uh) designed for planetary assaults,\nbut can also be used to inflict massive damage on quasi-stationary targets\nsuch as orbital installations or heavy battleships. For the latter purpose,\neach bomb has a proximity sensor, and will detonate when close an enemy target.\n\nTo prevent premature bomb detonations that may damage the ship itself,\nthe deployed bombs are inactive. Only a confirmation signal (sent when\nthe Bomber's pilot releases the bomb deploy button) will activate the warhead.\n\nExtreme caution is recommended when attempting bombardment in zero-G environment.\n\n\n2. Special:\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ship is equipped with a dual decoy launcher system. Decoys will mislead\nor even temporarily jam practically any targeting system locked onto the Bomber.\nThis system is a very effective defense against homing weapons, but can also\nbe used to confuse enemy ships to let the Bomber pilot enough time to get away.\nUnfortunately, decoys are relatively short-lived.\n\n\nAcknowledgements: SquireSoft (for inspiration drawn from StarHavoc)\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>\n\nLast update: 24 Jan 2003"

    "description": "-----------\n*Tau* Turbo\n-----------\n\nUser's Manual:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nHere's a few tips that should help you get a grip on piloting this utterly unbalanced and completely \"unSC-ish\" ship.\n\n1. Engine.\n\nIn addition to a standard inertia-less drive this ship is equipped with a turbo ram-scoop booster.\nThe booster is most effective when traveling at high speed, facing in the direction of movement.\nAn unfortunate side effect is that if you activate the engine while facing significantly off the\ndirection of movement, you will slow down your ship. Getting up to speed again will take precious time,\nso the best tactics is to keep going non-stop (be careful and avoid collisions and sharp turns).\n\n2. Weapon.\n\nNothing out-of-the-ordinary here - just a couple of heat-seeking missiles.\n\n3. Shield.\n\nThis ship is equipped with Mark VIII damper shield, which can absorb practically *any* damage.\nThe shield activates automatically, provided there is enough energy in the ship's battery reserve.\nWhile active, shield is constantly draining small amount of energy, so make sure you deactivate it\nwhen it is no longer needed (press \"special\" function key to deactivate the shield). Keep in mind,\nhowever, that activating the shield again might take more energy than keeping it up for a while.\n\nNote:\n\nNeither weapons nor turbo booster can operate while the shield is up\n(the basic inertia-less dirve can still be somewhat useful though).\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>"

    "description": "GLATHRIEL DESTROYER (v.3.0)\n\nThe Destroyer is a bulky ship that uses a combination of large, long-range non-homing missiles and a mini-missile system to vanquish its foes. It's not particularly fast, but it isn't the slowest ship out there either.  \n\nThe Destroyer uses a new kind of missile that releases beams of x-rays when it gets within range. However, the new weapon system makes it so that there is no room for a homing system, so pilots must have good aim. The x-rays blast in a pattern of 5 beams, spread over a wide angle, meaning that while small ships may escape with only minor damage, large ships will take multiple beams, resulting in massive damage. The warhead will not detonate within the range of the mini-missiles from the Destroyer. \n\nThe mini-missiles, leftover from the last war, are small, blindingly fast, and horribly inaccurate. While the Destroyer can release many of them, there is much conjecture as to why one would want to.\n\n\nShip originally created by Alstar, coded by LP and Orz.\n\nImproved graphics and code by *Tau*.\n---------------------------------------\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>"

The Phedar often expose themselves to hostile situations on planets, in space asteroid fields, and in combat; for their safety they've developed very effective personal armor.\n\nIf the structural integrity of the hull is breached whilst the crewmember\ufffds shield is activated, instead of dying, they will be sucked into nearby space. The Patrol Ship is then able to rescue them, storing the crewmembers in structurally secure areas of the vessel.\n\n\n\nHow to use this ship:\n\nThis tiny vessel is extremely fast and nimble, but has medium crew and a very short attack laser. The special is designed to save Phedar from the hostile situations they're in.\n\nMain = short laser.\n\nSpecial = activate personal shield, ie., hits don't result in deaths due to ship's hull rupture, but in crew loss in space. This takes all battery, and lasts for 4 seconds. This is more or less the opposite to the Syreen special.\n\nNote that crew members float around for 20 seconds, then they die. Also note that while the main vessel has it's special activated, it attracts free-floating crewmembers faster through their shield interaction.\n\n\nIdea/coding: Varith (original), GeomanNL (completely revised)."

    "description": "Idea: GeomanNL.\n\nShip: Gerl Hero.\n\nBasically, gerls are stupid beings. However, 2 of them can merge together to form a more capable member of their species, a Gerzel. Gerzels can form Gerzelles, Gerzelles even a Gerzellion, but that's beside the point now.\n\nThe basic gerl type, I'll call them morons for now, are just able to function as crew of a large spaceship and to keep it's engines and energy dynamo running, which stupidly flies through space following what I'm going to call the hero. The only \"intelligent\" thing they can do, is avoid the planet - but that is such a conspicuous immobile object, even they can do that.\n\nThe hero vessel contains a single Gerzel, who can fearlessly evade missiles, sneak onto an enemy ship, climb onto it, and deal some damage there. When attached to the enemy, he can even influence enemy flight a little by providing its own thrust. Manoeuvering and attack costs fuel though, which the small ship (or should I say, advanced space suit?) cannot produce. When the hero runs out of fuel, he dies. Special makes him leave the enemy ship.\n\nSitting on the back of a moving ship isn't that comfortable; it takes valuable energy to stay on top, and that is a rather scarce commodity in deep space.\n\nFortunately there's the moron ship. When the hero is close enough, he can refuel. When you use special, the hero positions himself in front of the ship's nose, after which the morons execute a \"launch\" command, which launches the hero at very high speeds. Very handy, because that'll save him fuel ;)\n\nRace: see story board."

    "description": "TAU ARCHON\n\nThis ship is based on the Denron Archon  - the ship designed by Scott Hunter a.k.a. Warlock)\nin both appearance and some of the weaponry characteristics (W).\n\nThe Archon's primary weapon is the formation and subsequent projection of the Crystal Storm\nfrom the ship front.  Each individual crystal consists of a matter with rather arcane physical\ncharacteristics \u2014 in fact, this matter is hyper-cold, and capable of absorbing tremendous\namounts of energy on contact (thus, a more appropriate name for the weapon would be the\nIce Storm).  If such a crystal hits a space vessel, it will freeze the crew (1) and drain some\nof the vessel's energy reserves (2).  Since absorption capacity of each crystal is limited,\nthe target ship will suffer less damage to the hull and crew if it has sufficient energy reserve.\nContact of a crystal with a high-energy source (such as a weapon or an energy projectile) is likely\nto result in the annihilation of both objects (3).  Surprisingly, this weapon has only minimal effect\non large non-energetic object (such as asteroids) (4).\n\nThe secondary function of the Crystal Storm is to provide protection for the Archon.  If activated,\nthis function will project the \"ice crystals\" on random concentric or spiral paths around the ship,\nforming a large protective cloud, difficult to penetrate with most types of weaponry and deadly for\nany ship foolish enough to approach.  Both weapon and special functions use the same emitter (5),\nand require a short charging time (6).\n\n\nTechnical notes:\n\n(1) The crew will die if frozen.  When the last crewmember is frozen, the whole ship will freeze.\nThe Crystal Strom will not freeze ships (and simply destroy them instead) if you set \"DoFreeze = 1\"\nin the ship's INI file.\n\n(2) Set both FuelSap parameter to zero in the INI file in order to disable the battery draining effect.\n\n(3) In addition to \"normal\" damage, any object that comes in contact with an Ice Crystal will suffer\ndamage equal to its damage_factor (shot damage for projectiles, for example).  To disable this feature,\nset DoReactiveDamage = 0 in the INI file (not, however, that this will make the Archon's defense much\nmore vulnerable to projectile weapons).\n\n(4) DO NOT set the DamageMin to zero, otherwise ships with high battery regeneration (as well as\nasteroids and similar objects) will become completely immune to Archon's weaponry.\n\n(5) All parameters but speed and range are the same for the primary and secondary functions\nof the Crystal Storm (see INI file).  Please note that the actual battery drain per crystal is equal to\n(weapon_drain / special_drain).\n\n(6) While the charging (ChargeTime in the INI file) time is relatively short, it is the most critical part\nin the Archon's tactics, since it gives the enemy the opportunity to score some hits or evade\nthe line of fire while Archon is charging its weapon or deffense.  Please note that the bright glow\nis the indication that the weapon is charging/charged.\n\n(W) How this ship is different from the Denrod Archon\n\nIn the Warlock's original design, Crystal storm would do no immediate damage to the target,\nbut instead deposit individual crystals until a critical mass is reach (at which point the object\nwould become frozen/dead).  This is rather complicated in both implementation and game balance\n(for example, ships with high firepower (or kamikaze pilots) would simple approach and destroy Archon\nwith impunity before its crystals would take their toll), so I decided to make the weapon a little more\nsimple and dynamic, while retaining most of the \"cool\" effects.\n\nAlso, in the original design, the crystal would track the target somewhat.\n\nAnd finally, the Denrod Archon design had a special that would replicate the special function\nof the opposing ship.  This approach is quite questionable in both implementation and the in-game logic\nbehind it, so I decided to develop a special I though would better suit this ship.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>\n\n13 February 2003"

    "description": "Idea: GeomanNL\n\nShip: The Hotspot\n\nThis ship is a tweaked space lens. Very ingenius, it focuses light from an exposed energy source onto a single intensely hot spot in the far distance. A system of gyroscopes makes the weapon manageable at long distances, by slowing turning rate when focussed far away.\n\nYou can light the source by pressing fire. You can control the lens manually after the weaon is activated by pressing fire (increase) or special (decrease distance). This controls the point where the dangerous hotspot is projected.\n\nThe special (special+fire) ejects the nuclear source into space, where it is a dangerous object for a short while. It's expendable, and the Vinsmel always have a new energy source ready, but you instantly lose all battery power. It can only be ejected if enough power, namely 75% of battery, is remaining.\n\nRace: the VinsMel\n\n(GeomanNL/ Bristle/ (Culture20))\n\nHotspot Aliens - they use the hotspot ship.\n\nBy nature extremely nearsighted, see the entire world in a blur. Their environment was bright, with little variation; moreover, they'd scavenge for food on the surface of dried-up ponds and streams, so their short legs/arms and their near-sightedness was good enough for their survival.\n\nLive on the extremely bright surface of a sunbaked planet.\n\nThe planet has a few salty seas where life is plentyful; and mountainous areas with temporary streams; further, there are tundras, steppes and lots of desert.\n\nCatlike appearance, short legs/arms, big head, wear big glasses.\n\nClose Minded - as in, very much absorbed in their own thoughts. They've difficulty to communicate with the outside world; this dull appearance hides their inner emotions and fantasies which can be very complex, interesting and sometimes, even dangerous. It is hard to make contact, but once you do, you gain access to a world with unexpected depths, which can be both positive and negative.\n\nFriendly - they usually hardly notice your presence, but when they do, are easily able to insert your presence in their own personal mental world... the resulting physical response (if any) can vary from anger to disinterest or even love.\n\nNerds - as in, they use their gadgets and knowledge for their own pursuit of nerd-like thoughts (lust, revenge, fear).\n\nGIANT myopic glasses - they wear big glasses in order to see the world around them. At the same time, those glasses form a safe barrier between them and the world, from which they can safely observe it.\n\nEarly - Tribal, small groups of VinsMel examining the groun closely for food (plants, animals, insects). On the banks of a stream, a VinsMel found a giant lens, naturally shaped by the water, of quite pure transparent crystal. When looking through it, the VinsMel could observe distant objects as clearly as the seeds and insect he searched for on the ground.\n\nThe tribe that possessed the giant lens (naturally formed phenomenon) became dominant, since they had an obvious advantage; planning ahead, knowing where to go! By seeing their environment as a whole, they were able to advance significantly in science.\n\nThe biggest advance was not the invention of fire, or electricity; it was when the tribe learned to make new artificial lenses of other crystals. Thus, the VinsMel entered the age of clear-sightedness.\n\nThe influence of the tribe with the lens created a society always looking for a new widget that would give them more influence and an advantage over the others.  Their government evolved into a technocracy based on \"early adoption\", the one who has the most toys doesn't just win, he's in charge. Because he has the advantage, and the means, to make his own wishes come true at the expense of all others.\n\nThey covet all technology, and shiny objects.  Inevitably, their good intentions always lead to accidental abuse of their technology.\n\nCurrent leader has acquired a synthetic lens from a magnifying glass, accidentally left by a nature hiker on their planet.\n\nThey had only just launched a giant telescope into space, for the purpose of studying the star. A bright young student, studying a particularly boring star, accidentally discovered a dangerous asteroid out of orbit when it was on collision course with their planet. Coincidentally, he was just thinking of the process that focused the light of that uninteresting star on his blurry eye, dazing away he realized, he could reverse the process! He exposed their nuclear power source and indeed, burnt the asteroids into small bits, which showed that the giant telescope lens could also be used as a weapon (thus, the hotspot ship). Btw, the VinsMel make the biggest lenses and most powerful telescopes throughout known space.\n\nShort, stocky, in space wearing bulky rubbery space suits, on the hot surface wearing wide sparse clothing (boxer shorts, sun glasses, T-shirts).\n\nThis is the time at which they encounter a new species."

    "description": "EARTHLING CRUISER MK3\n\nThis ship represents yet another attempt to make a worthy \"new generation\" Earthling ship.\nStarted a along time ago, it would never be competed if it was not for Starwreck, which\ninspired that last effort needed to bring this ship to life.  And, sure enough, this attempt\nbrings the Earthling Cruiser a step or two closer to its 'Treck predecessors (which is not\nnecessarily a bad thing).\n\nPrimary weapon on this ship is the proton torpedo launcher, capable of firing highly destructive\nprojectiles at long range.  Advanced targeting system automatically tracks all major targets in range\nand calculates optimum firing angle.  However, the launcher itself is limited to a relatively small\nfiring arc, and can take some time to aim in on target.  The limited accuracy is an inherited problem\nof all existing proton torpedo launchers.\n\nSecondary weapon system is the short-range point defense laser (PDL).  The beam can be fired\nin short bursts, with some time required to cool down the emitter.   Each burst is automatically\naimed at the nearest non-friendly object.  If the object is destroyed or is out of range, PDL can\nquickly acquire a new target.  This weapon is especially effective against projectile weapons.\n----------------------------\n\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>\n\n30 Jan 2003"

    "description": "EARTHLING CRUISER MK2  (code name \"Crusader\") v.1.4\n\nNew technological advances and reverse engineering of some of the Precursors' technology\nmade possible the construction of this ship. It is faster, with higher energy capacity and regeneration.\nIts weapon is a replica of the Fusion Blasters (a bit less powerfull than its Precursor analogue though)\nwith ATS. Point Defense Laser now fires twice as fast.\n\nUnfortunately, with all that machinery there was just not enough space abroad, so crew capacity had\nto be decreased (not significantly, though). And, to improve maximum speed and acceleration, some of\nthe maneuverability (for which Cruiser is known) had to be sacrificed in order to accommodate more thrusters.\n\nNote 1: Be very careful with the new PDL - it can deplete your battery in a glimpse.\n\nNote 2: Mk2's ATS is somewhat inferior to its Precursor's analogue, and cannot efficiently work at short range.\nSo don't rely too much on homing in close-up combat; fire from medium and long range to utilize your ATS to\nits full capacity.\n\n----------------------------\nProgramming, graphics and sound: Tau\nConcept 3D ship model: Slag786B\n\n\n<twships@tau137.com>"

Apparetly, they\nrecognize the need to have warships, but they have\nonly partially grasped the practical needs of\nbuilding combat spacecraft.\n\nfire = delayed thrust missile.  2 power to launch, 4\ndamage when they hit.  For unknown reasons, the\nship is equipped with a missile release bay, but\nnot a missile firing tube.  The unguided missile\nstarts to thrust after it drops free of the ship.\n\nspecial = ionic turbochager.  Cost is all of the\nenergy in the battery.  This turns on the ionic\nturbocharger in the engine.  The more energy in\nthe battery when activated, the longer the\nturbocharge.  However, thrust is continuous, and\nmay not be turned off early.  Turning also becomes\nworse.  This is meant to allow the ship to escape\nfrom danger."

Instead of producing a happier and prosperous society, it became one of oppression and poverty of the masses, versus extreme wealth and power for the 'New Breed'. Their planet was rechristened \"Perfection\" by the New Breed, but it's far from perfect. They painted a big star on their ship, to reflect their high star-status.\n\nThe devastator is designed to get rid of anything that wants to come too close to the Uber-Captain, while also being effective at long range.\n\nMain weapon: Space Distortion Gun (or SDG). Long range and highly dangerous (6d).\nSpecial Weapon: mortar fire, creates small explosions around the ship at medium range (1d);it concentrates fire on 5 locations, related to the star pattern on the ship.\nQuirk: Use of the main slows the ship down. Combine this with poor accel rate; fortunately there's the mortar fire which can create a protective ring around the ship."

Instead, they pierce the target's armour\nand \"latch\" onto the hull, applying all the thrust of their engine to accelerate and rotate\n(depends on the moment of force) the enemy.

    "description": "Gahmur Monitor\n\nThis is a behemoth-class ship which uses\nhoming plasma projectile as the primary armament.\n\nfire:  Holding down the fire button charges up\nthe plasma launcher.  Plasma projectiles may be\ndamaged in a way similar to mycon torpedoes, but\nare more resistant to damage.  The plasma projectiles\nlose power as they travel further from the point of\nlaunch.  While charging, the dynamo does not recharge\nthe battery.\n\nrelease fire:  releasing the fire button launches\na charged plasma projectile.  Anywhere from\none to forty points of power may be in the\nprojectile.  The charging curve is non-linear:\n1 power : damage 3, range 15, speed 15.\n20 power: damage 9, range 50, speed 35.\n40 power: damage 16, range 85, speed 55.\n\nThe plasma projectile automatically is facing the target.\nThese cannot injure the firing ship.\n\nfire + special:  Only has an effect if the fire\nbutton has been held down and the plasma launcher\nhas been charged up.  This uses the current\nenergy in the launcher to fire a beam of coherent\nplasma straight ahead from both launchers.\nThe damage and effect is non-linear:\n\n1 power: 2 beams, damage 1 each, range 5\n20 power: 2 beams, damage 4 each, range 25\n40 power: 2 beams, damage 8 each, range 45\n\nspecial:  Pushing and releasing the special\n(without the fire button) toggles the tractor\nbeam on and off.  Activating the tractor\nbeam stops the dynamo, costs 4 power, and\ncontinues to cost 4 power per second.\nThe beam slowly extends in front of the ship.\nWhen the tractor beam hits an object with\nmass, it holds the two units together, although\nnot perfectly.\n\nHolding a target in a tractor beam only costs\n1 power per second.  Also, 1 point of direct\ndamage is done every second to a target caught\nin the tractor beam."

    "description": "Ducly Lanternjaws\n\nThe Duclies would've been flying a \"standard\" ship, if it were not for an unfortunate encounter with a powerful space monster relatively early in their history. They had only just begun colonizing their solar system, with lots of internal struggles going on between Ducly nations. Those wars soon stopped after the arrival of a pregnant space monster in their system, warping in from hyperspace and laying about in the remote asteroid belt. When the Ducly attacked, the monster fought back with a rage of fury. The proud Ducly were no match, the monster ate their ships for breakfast. Only by uniting and striking together in force, they were able to destroy the monster and its layer before more of those creatures could be born. They lost 90 percent of their fleet in the battle, and it was just one monster. They analyzed data from the battles with the monster, and performed autopsy on the remains, which were often badly damaged. Thus they aquired hyperspace tech, they could re-create the giant laser arcs it used to scare its prey and forcing it into its mouth, and the powerful multi-purpose waste-energy exhaust. Unfortunately, the monster's power source was badly damaged, and they couldn't figure out how the monster performed his ultra-rapid thrusting and turning that surprised so many a pilot. The replacement power source they built allows for a much weaker arc and exhaust, and their accel and turning is hardly an improvement compared to their old fleet designs. With the information they built a new fleet of ships, in shape of the monster to strike fear in the hearts of their enemies. Even though _much_ weaker than the monster ever was, the ship is quite a match in a fight.\n\nmain = backward laser shots.\n\nspecial = two giant laser arcs.\n\nquirks = the mouth is deadly, and the backward firing lasers give some accel."

    "description": "Arilou Trapper (v0.2)\n\nCoded by: MAZ (maz@creativelygenius.com)\nGraphics by: MAZ (maz@creativelygenius.com)\nMusic by: Dragst\n\n  The Arilou Trapper was originaly designed by Arilou scientists to trap *Nnngn*.  Because they weren't real enough to touch in our dimension the Trapper is designed to enter they're reality ( a place between here and quasi space), at which point it can (almost) be touched.  This means when in that dimension the ship will only take half normal damage.  You can not see the Arilou Trapper when it is in subquasi (cloaked) and it also has a top speed 2.5 times faster due to interdimensional effects.\n  The main weapon is Quasi-Degenerated-blackhole that does two damaga and uses 3 battery.  If activated within subquasi, the weapon creates a energy-blackhole, this is attracted to the external active powersource of the ship you are tracking, or more specificaly the energy it has.  This causes it to home in on the ship and attach to it, draining it's battery and disabling it.  Once the batteries are drained the energy-blackhole has nothing to feed on and colapses in on itself.\n  The ship also has a unique propulsion system, where the turning thrusters are actually pointed forward.  This means when you turn, you also thrust back to the side opposite the way you are turning.  If both left and right turn are active, the ship will thrust backwards (slowing it down and then reversing it).  With practice I have found this to actually be very usefull and gives the ability to orbit a ship while pointing directly at it.\n  Only one crew but 9 regenerative shield points (regenerate when energy is full)\n\n\nMain Weapon: shot, range=20, damage=2, energycost=3\n\nSpecial:     subquasi (cloak with increased shields and faster speed)\n\nMain Weapon fired while cloaked:\n  Homing energyhole, disables ship and drains energy.\n\nHold left and right:\n  Thrust backwards\n\n\n\n\n// Stuff I am still doing:\n//     some animation code, would like to redo the energy draining weapon\n//         graphics to surround the entire ship being drained\n\nIf anyone would like to suggest changes to this ship please e-mail MAZ at\nmaz@creativelygenius.com\nAll I ask is that I be allowed to make major changes myself."

This is on by default, as long as there is battery left... otherwise it's at a minimum, making them vulnerable to positive-world attacks. Movement in real-space drains energy quickly.\n\nWeapon: a long range plasma missile, pretty fast, and homing as well!\n\nSpecial: come to an immediate stop, and emit a small cloud. This cloud become the target of one of missiles that are around, if they were originally homing in on the ship.\n\nRace: the Batha (by IAmTheSongman).\n\nIn one area of space, there exists a \"pocket\" of antimatter, for no discernible reason. Some think it was caused by Precursor experiments. Others think it was \"ripped\" from a different dimension and placed here by...something. In this pocket exist a star system, which consists of one star, one planet, and one moon. On this one planets there lives a sentient race. I'll call them the Batha for convenience. The Batha are a starfaring race, at roughly the same tech level as the Yehat. Their first few extrasolar ships, however, disappeared in a flash of light. Eventually they discovered that by installing antigravity devices they could prevent probes from being destroyed. But when they sent Batha, they consistently came back completely nutters. Jumpy and paranoid, their minds had cracked from the stress of thinking about the matter around them. The only way they could prevent this from happening was to send people who were already slightly barmy. But this they could not do, for the only people who could actually pilot the Deviants were those so utterly insane that they could not be used. Several attempts were made, and one brilliant government worker hit on the idea of mind-altering drugs. In all standard Deviant models currently active, there is one burner which incenerates a weed similar in effect to the Earthling marijuana. This would also provide a logical choice between the two primary ideas. Pyrotechnic, dude! \n\nIf you 'ally' with the Batha, the captains dock on the starbase, utterly destroying it. Thus you cannot ally with the Batha without losing the game. If you enter the \"pocket\" without some certain item, you automatically lose the game due to the antimatter/matter reaction. However, with this item, you can go the the Batha homeworld, where (unless you pissed of some Batha captain(which would take a lot of doing)), they will be sympathetic to your cause and give you two Batha Deviants."

This appears\nto be a rip in space-time, in the form of a miniature\n'white hole'.  Over time, it grows in strength, as numerous\nspinning tendrils emerge.  The tendrils do damage to other\nships and shots that may come near it.  The sanctuary itself\nis difficult, but not impossible to destroy.\n\n2) Redeploy Sanctuary.  If the special is held down for\nfive seconds while the ship is outside the sanctuary, it will\nbe redeployed in the current spot, and the old sanctuary \ndestroyed.\n\n3) Harvest.  If the ship is flying over one or more tendrils,\npushing and holding the special will cause the tendrils to be\nharvested.  This destroys the tendril, and gives 1-9 energy,\ndepending on the strength of the tendril.  If the battery\nis full, the ship can regenerate 1 crew for every 20 energy\nthat would have been created.\n\nThe Emissary has no dynamo.  However,\nthe Emissary may use the tendrils of the Sanctuary to recharge\nitself and regenerate.  Each tendril that touches the emissary\ngives the Emissary a small amount of energy.  To obtain energy\nrapidly, it must use the special button to harvest the tendrils.\nIn effect, the sanctuary is something of a 'fortress'.  The\nEmissaries own pulse blasters will interfere with the tendrils,\nso the Emissary must emerge from the Sanctuary to do battle.\n\nThere may only be one Sanctuary in existence at a time.\nCreation of a new sanctuary destroys the old one.\n\nUpon the destruction of the ship, the Sanctuary is also\ndestroyed."

    "description": "The Korvian Sidekick is designed to be an assistant for other vessels.  The primary fire is a long-range machine gun that sits atop a rotating turret.  The Sidekick's movement is controlled by the secondary weapon, which activates a short-range gravity field that causes the Sidekick to follow a nearby object, such as an asteroid or a ship.  The Sidekick is very useful in team games, as it can latch on to a fast ship for assistance during attack.\n\nNOTES:  The velocity of the object that the Sidekick attaches to must be close to that of the Sidekick.  This ship is based on the code for the Orz Nemesis, and I still haven't figured out how to change the victory music."

    "description": "\"TAU\" GLADIUS\n\nThis ship has long and somewhat sad history.  It was originally designed for the Team\nfor one of the new races, and went through numerous revisions.  While the weaponry\nstayed more or less the same, all of the original \"quirks\" (and there were quite a few)\nwere eventually removed.  The visual characteristics of the ship also changed for the better,\nalthough the latest version has no additional animations (such as the gun rotation), since\nthey would be practically unnoticeable at the current ship size.\n\nA note on weapons: primary is just what it looks like; the secondary is a homing missile, but it\nwill loose its target if it went outside the tracking angle.\n\nCredits: the old TW team (especially TGF) provided input and feedback on design;\nFusion made the prototype 3D model, which was used (after some re-working) for\nthe first version renderings; later on significant aesthetic improvements to the model\nwere made by Forevian. The rest of the work (design, modeling and re-modeling work,\ntextures, rendering, code, sfx, etc.) were done by yours truly.\n\nAnd since in the last year or so there was no apparent interest on the part of the Team\nin using this ship/design in the full game, I decided to publish a re-designed version for\nthe open melee (after changing the name and victory ditty, of course).  At least this way there\nwill be _some_ use for time and effort put into this ship.\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>\n\n9 Feb 2003"

    "description": "Meknik Pincer.\n\nAdapted by GeomanNL from an idea of JadtheGerbil.\nHere's a copy of the topic:\n\n\nMeknik Pincer:\n\nA gigantic multipurpose ship asteroid miner retrofitted by the Meknik for battle purposes. Medium-sized ship, resembles a huge Swiss Army knife in function, but more like a sphere w/ attachments in form.\n\nPRIMARY: PINCER-Class Lasers:\nLongish-Range lasers, used primarily for breaking up asteroids; fires in a wide spread (~20 degrees)\n\nSECONDARY: MINeral Re-allocators [MINCER]\nTwo spinning blades of death (like chainsaws) circle the ship; melee weapon\n\nPictures to come\n\n-- Lengthy BackStory --\n\nRace: Meknik\n\nA hardy race with a very short lifespan and a technological gift were enshielded by the Kzer-Za hundreds of Earth-Years ago. Because of their rather short life-span (only 5 or so Earth years), they didn't have much time for the every day mundane things in life, instead trusting that to robots of their own creation. Automatons of limitless lifespan (thanks to fusion powercells) served as a link between generations, helping to educate and instruct, and keep the living legacy alive.\n\nWhen the Ur-Quan came along, they crippled the race with an EMP blast, eliminating nearly everything. They succumbed in days. \n\nThis cataclysmic event came to be known as The Blast and serving as a new reference for their calendar measured Post-Blast. \n\nThe defeated race chose enshieldment. The Ur-Quan did, however, give them a space station with a super-computer that held all their data for them, easily accessible through portals, but encrypted with security measures that would take them 20 lifetimes to crack to prevent retrofitting.\n\nWhen the supply ships stopped coming years ago, the people aboard the station realized that their genetic code had reached a bottleneck. Without the variability of the various planets they'd colonized affecting their gene pool, they were slowly dying of genetic instabilities and diseases they were previously immune to. W/o resupplies, they, and their children, would die.\n\nDozens of years before, however, they'd reprogrammed the dumb maintenance robots aboard the station to serve as pale surrogates of the personal companions they'd held before The Blast. As their race gasped for breath, they furiously worked to upload their consciousness into their new drones, but found their time too short to do so. As the last scientist died, he hit the Calculate button on the Intelligence-O-Matic, with an estimated time of completion of \"about 20 years\".\n\nThe robots, model MK-NK Helper Class, became aware alone, in a large dark space station orbitting a red planet. They called themselves the Meknik and their initial task as outlined in the Great Queue of Precendence was to hack the mainframe. You find them in this state.\n\nPARTICULARS:\n\nThe Meknik are a very new race and much resemble eager to please 12 year olds. However, they possess a technological prowess unsurpassable among your allies, as well as a deep and understated culture, which I can go into later.\n\nImagine a mix of the Spathi, Zot-Foq-Pik, and Mrnmnhrm."

It's physically large, but that's only because I wanted to have a spinning asteroid as part of the ship.  The front of the ship is flanged outward; this is where the ship's tractor beam comes from.\n\nWeapon: Multi-Use Tractor Beam.  \nCost: 8 to activate or deactivate prematurely\nRange:6 (from center of ship)\nTime: The Beam lasts for 6000 frames (not sure what that is in seconds, 6?)\nDescription:  The Chorali use their tractor beams for just about everything.  They didn't invent the beams, they found the technology on a dead world and replicated it, but they can at least come up with new uses.  First, the beams will draw any matter they come in contact with (currently just ships and asteroids, I tried to get the cargo chain from the confed cargotran to work, but I'm not sure what way would be proper).  The beams also turn any ships they draw, so that they will not continue to fire at the Extractor (watch out for B.U.T.T. missles). If the object is drawn completely to the Extractor, it will be held stationary (no thrust or turning, fire & special still work) until the beam's duration is done.  If the fire button is pressed while an asteroid is held, the asteroid is lobbed at high velocity towards the current target.  Weak long range tractor beams will occasionally correct the trajectory of the missile. \n[AsteroidMissile]\nRange    = 60\nVelocity = 80\nDamage   = 2\nArmour   = 1\nTurnRate = 2\nThe beams will also push away any objects that the onboard computer thinks are dangerous.  Currently, the only homing missiles it can keep at bay are Mycon plasmoids and Khor-Ah blades.\n\n\nSpecial:  Planet-Fall.\nCost: 1\nRate: 0\nThe Chorali have discovered that their tractor beams can also be used on nearby planets with surpising success.  If the beams are not focused, they will draw the ship towards the planet.  Used in combination with the main weapon, the Extractor can force enemy ships to crash into the planet.\n\nQuirk: If the highly focused beams of the main weapon are used on the planet, chunks of matter are lifted from the planet, making asteroids (of a non-regenerating type, to keep the amount of permanent asteroids to a minimum)."

The torpedo is extremely slow though\n(even warheads have lower-than-average velocity).\n\nNote: Torpedo itself will not do damage on collisions (only launched warheads will). \n\nTurrets:\n--------\nPress \"special\" to turn them on or off (look in the upper-right corner\nof the \"captain screen\" to see current state). When on, turrets will\nautomatically shoot on possible targets in range. Priority list is\n(descending): your target, any enemy ship, non-damaging things,\nheavy shots.\n\nNote: Turrets can be damaged (disabled).\n\nEngines:\n--------\n\nNote: Engines can be damaged, crippling an already slow ship.\n\nShield:\n-------\nAutomatic absorbance shield can block most of the incoming damage.\nDoes not work when/if overloaded by continuous heavy fire.\nThe shield status indicator is located in the upper-left corner\nof the \"captain screen\"\n\nNote: Shield does cover turrets and engines.\n\n\nQuirk #1:\n---------\nDamage (even direct) cut in half (to make this ship really tough\nwithout going over 42 crew (for aesthetic reasons)).\n\nQuirk #2:\n---------\n\"Slow death\" (beware of turret fire).\n\n\n-----------------------------------\n*Tau* <twships@tau137.com>\n\n\nLast updated on 31 Jan 2003."

It is \n controlled in the standard Orz-like fashion, with some differences.\n    First, it starts rotating slowly but rapidly accelerates to allow \n for both accuracy and rapid movement.  Second, it can rotate  while firing,\n slowly and hyperaccurately.  Third, it is canted far off to one side.\n Lastly, it can't rotate a full 360 degrees, only an odd 240 degree arc.\n\n\nWeaknesses\n Slow speed, bad turning, and a 'blind spot' where the turret can't aim.\n \nStrengths\n Large firing arc, high accuracy, and long range.\n\nRace:\n The Tridemin are radially symmetric rather than bilaterally symmetric; more\n like a starfish than a man.  This may explain their 360-degree perception\n and their odd ship design."

    "description": "The velron cruiser is a fast ship with a deadly main weapon.\nThere was a trade-off to achieve this, however.  The power\nfor the main weapon is drawn from the fusion engine that propels\nthe ship.  When the battery is depleted, the engine turns off\nuntil enough battery energy is stored to re-ignite the engine.\nThe maneuvering thrusters are also reduced during the battery recharge,\nbut to a lesser extent.\n\nfire = massive short range bolt (10 damage, 20 range, 10 energy to launch),\nusing this causes an engine flame-out until the battery refills.\n\nspecial = seven lasers project outward from the ship at various angles.  The\nenergy cost is a mere 1 as the lasers have an independent power source.  This\nsystem was installed to give the cruiser some defensive capability when the\nfusion engine was drained."

Although they are\nquite short ranged, they can quickly rip\nan opponent to shreds.\n\npressing the special button launches\na pair of long range missiles.  Each\nmissile has a massive warhead (4 pts\nof damage!) but the missiles are slow\nand do not track quickly.  They are used\nto kill slow moving, large ships and to\nrestrict the maneuvering of fast\nopponents."
